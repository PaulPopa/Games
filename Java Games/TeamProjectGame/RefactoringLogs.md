FORMATTING & DOC
================  
- Just re-formatting the code to make sense out of everything.
- Formatted and partially documented the "core" package, needs proof  
reading.
- Finished formatting and documenting "core"
- Formatted "entity" package needs doc for some methods.

REFACTORING
===========  
  
CORE
----  
Fixing core package first.  
  
- A lot of useless variables
- Members variables in wrong places?
- Member variables not properly initialised.
  
#### CoreEngine  
  
- Everything needs to be initialised in the Engine.  
- Core engine stores all the instances and other classes access them  
through the engine instance.
